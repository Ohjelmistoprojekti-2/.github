<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was designed and created for the course Ohjelmistoprojekti II. It acts as a learning experience about different web development technologies and project management. Our team wanted to study web scraping with Python, so we based our topic of the project on that.

DuuniApp utilizes Scrapy to gather data about available job positions from different web sites. This data is sent to a mobile application via Flask API. Users can browse available jobs and filter the results with conditions of their choice. Those conditions can be saved to the device for later use.
